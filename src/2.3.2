Do not change this file except for its name.


Change this third digit (and leave others unchanged) with each upload.
Change the second digit (and reset third) upon each major goal completion.
Change the first digit (and reset others) upon each official renaming of robot.



Virtually all robots will go on two version identifiers, one being of the form
    i.x.x, and the other being i+1.x.x, because nearly all robots are renamed
    upon completion.
