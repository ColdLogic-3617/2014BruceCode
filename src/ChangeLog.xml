        DriveTrain.java
        Jostle.java

    Added safety measure to Jaw control, so that it can't shoot while lowered
}

    Implemented small use of SmartDashboard.  Effectiveness TBD
    Learned how to attatch javadoc to WPI packages (link below)

    (This was reverted after it destroyed gappleto's computer)
}

Scarab Version 1.2.0
{
    ERROR-Memory leak discovered
    By changing Driver.java instance creation, we have reduced crash-time to ~14
        minutes, and counting
    Changed if-statement conditions on Driver.java
    Removed GB2/3 instances in OI.java
    Entirely rewrote OI<->Driver interface

    Robot did not crash after 45+ minutes, almost certainly exceeding battery
        capacity for any useful function.  Memeory leak eliminated.
